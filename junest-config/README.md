#Scripts to configure [junest](https://github.com/fsquillace/junest) on portal.physik

Using junest seemed non-trivial on our university accounts, so I wrote down how I
configured junest on the CIP pool computers.

Warning: I created these scripts a long ago. Since then,
there were significant changes to the CIP pool configuration
and I don't have access anymore, so the scripts probably won't
work anymore.
Also, the scripts delete stuff so double check, it's just a few lines!
