# Miscellaneous Linux Programms

A collection of small scripts/programs I wrote, usually for family members that asked for a specific functionality.
If you want to use one of these, you have to adjust the paths in the .desktop files if you use these.
All codes are available under AGPLv3.

##image
A Tkinter interface for imagemagick to make images smaller. It uses the resize and quality options with sliders in the GUI and allows JPG or PDF output.

## battery
This program checks in a loop if the battery is almost empty (<20%) and sends a notification if neccessary.
